# Countdown Timer Python Project

## Overview
The **Countdown Timer Python Project** is a simple console-based application that allows users to input a time duration in seconds, and the program will count down until reaching zero. It demonstrates the use of loops, user input handling, time management, and system commands to clear the console.

## Features
- Allows the user to set a countdown timer in seconds
- Displays the remaining time dynamically
- Clears the console to provide a clean countdown display
- Handles invalid user input gracefully
- Allows manual interruption using `CTRL + C`

## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the number of seconds for the countdown.
3. The timer will start counting down, updating the remaining time every second.
4. When the countdown reaches zero, a message "Time's up!" is displayed.
5. To exit early, press `CTRL + C`.

## Project Structure
```
Project_6_Countdown_Timer/
│── countdown_timer.py  # Main script
│── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Code Explanation
- **`get_user_time()`**: Prompts the user for a valid countdown duration.
- **`clear_console()`**: Clears the console for a better user experience.
- **`countdown_timer(seconds)`**: Performs the countdown and updates the display every second.
- **`main()`**: Runs the program and handles user input.

## Example Output
```
Enter the countdown time in seconds: 5

Countdown Timer
Time remaining: 5 seconds
Time remaining: 4 seconds
Time remaining: 3 seconds
Time remaining: 2 seconds
Time remaining: 1 second
Time's up!
